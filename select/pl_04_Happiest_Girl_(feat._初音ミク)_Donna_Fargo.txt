You could've been the happiest girl in the world
If only some god had made a rule
Rule you could get something to be rewarded
With the same amount of your crying
願いをかけても　思い通りに
雨は止まずに　帰り道を探す
君の想いが涙を　運んだ時
また会えると
In reality everyone's been made to have
Some inevitability in their life
But your abandoning and compromising
I believe they will mean a great deal to you
届かぬ未来の自分の姿
それでもきっと　過ちじゃないから
忘れるだけじゃいけない
だけど今日は夢だけ見て
You could've been the happiest girl in the world
If only some god had made a rule
Rule you could get something to be rewarded
With the same amount of your crying
