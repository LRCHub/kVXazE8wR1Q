Shine on me, sunshine
Walk with me, world
It's a skip-a-dee-do-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole USA

Good morning, morning, hello, sunshine
Wake up, sleepy head
Why'd we move that bojangle clock
So far away from the bed?

Just one more minute, that's why we moved it
One more hug will do
Do you love wakin' up next to me
As much as I love wakin' up next to you?

You make the coffee, I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch, and you fix mine
Now tell me the truth, do these old shoes look funny?
Honey, it's almost nine

Now you be careful
Got to go, I love you
Have a beautiful day
And kiss the happiest girl in the whole USA

Skip-a-dee-do-dah, thank you, Lord
For makin' him for me
And thank you for letting life turn out the way
That I always thought it could be

There once was a time
When I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
I'm the happiest girl in the whole USA

Now shine on me, sunshine
Walk with me, world
It's a skip-a-dee-do-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole USA

Shine on me, sunshine
Walk with me, world
It's a skip-a-dee-do-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole USA

Shine on me, sunshine
Walk with me, world
It's a skip-a-dee-do-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole USA
